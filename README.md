## Introduction

Recent years have seen the fast development of USTC icourse.club, which is a communication forum sharing comments and opinions on some courses taught by their lecturers. 

The icourse.club has also been keeping pace with the times. In 2022, 4 new features were added to this website, and the community norms was also rewritren to meet some new requirements. Today we see that our club has grown into a grand community and gained its popularity among our students.

However, it needs more. The website, with massive number of comments, can be seen as a corpus, which means that we could apply machine-learning algorithms to accomplish **text classification** work, helping students make sound judgements on a course and thus choose them in a faster and wiser way.
